## **What you'll learn-and how you can apply it**

**By the end of this live, hands-on, online course, you’ll understand**:

- What variables are, and how to explore them given their type
- How the central limit theorem provides the “missing link” between descriptive and inferential statistics
- How statistics and visualizations each play a part in effective quantitative analysis

**And you’ll be able to**:

- Explore a dataset for potential research questions, check assumptions and build hypotheses
- Test formally whether the value of one group is greater than another, on average, given their respective samples
- Make compelling business recommendations using inferential statistics
